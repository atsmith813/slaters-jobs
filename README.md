# README

Welcome to Tsunami Jobs, where we're making waves for OSU Job Opportunities!

This project is a simple job board that uses an ATOM feed of available jobs at OSU. I was just getting my feet wet and introducing myself to concepts/gems/ideas such as:

* Sorting

* Whenever

* Feedjira

* Cron jobs

* Heroku deployment

* Git

* And more!


P.S.
I'm very new to all of this.
